HR Analytics Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end HR Analytics workflow using Python, MySQL, and Power BI. The goal is to transform raw HR data into actionable insights through data cleaning, analysis, database integration, and interactive dashboards.

Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze employee data to uncover insights related to workforce trends, employee performance, and turnover. The project integrates multiple tools to create a scalable and data-driven analytics solution.

Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning (Python)

Cleaned raw HR dataset using Python and Pandas.

Handled missing values and corrected inconsistent data.

Converted columns into proper formats (e.g., datetime).

Removed unnecessary columns and reorganized the dataset.

Exported the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

2. Database Integration (MySQL)

Created a MySQL database to store HR data.
